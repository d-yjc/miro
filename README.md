## Miiro
Miiro is a project management website built via NextJS for the front-end, and Node/Express + AWS (S3, EC2, Amplify) for the backend & hosting.  
[Unfortunately, I've run out of credits so I cannot continue running on AWS :( ] However, please take a look at the outline below for the AWS solution!
